			<h3>For Power</h3>
				<p>Deep within the earth's crust lies... dinosaurs! Prehistoric mammals and reptiles!</p>
				<p>
				Of course, only the <em>fossils</em> of these creatures remain, however when substances like coal are formed by anaerobic decomposition,
				we burn these for energy - these are our fossil fuels.

			<h3>For Food</h3>
				<p>Without earth, soil, and plant life, we wouldn't be here today.</p>
				<p>
				We owe a lot to agriculture and growing crops. How else would we have grown food - either plant-based or animal - without it?
				And don't forget the fact we breathe the oxygen that trees release!
