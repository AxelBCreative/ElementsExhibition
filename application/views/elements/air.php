				<p>
				Wind turbine power is our cleanest and safest form of energy. Full stop. 
				The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Array" target="blank">London Array</a> is
				expected to generate 630 megawatts (MW) of power alone, with the potential to become a gigawatt farm
				in the future!

			<h3 class="tab-head">For Fun</h3>
				<p>
				Sailing and Hot Air Ballooning are just two of the fun past times that require air and wind for the enjoyment.
				One of these sports is also one you can experience at the Elements Exhibition... but we're not telling you which!
